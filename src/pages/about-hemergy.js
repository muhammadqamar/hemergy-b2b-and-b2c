                  <p className="p-sm text-herotext">
                    Decentralization is a major force that energy transition will fully rely on. Blockchain is gaining momentum and come up with concrete solutions in the energy
                    sector. But, a true and seamless link between energy and financial models doesn’t exist yet to accelerate the energy transition.

                  <p className="p-sm text-herotext">
                    Hemergy’s ambition is to provide a fully compliant crypto-solution that irrigates finance and energy value chains, just like blood circulating between two
                    organs in one body. We want to open a new era of abundance by reimagining links between financial and energy sectors.

                    A local renewable energy actor may propose to install PV panels on a school rooftop. They are accredited to sign PPA with the school, but both need funding to
                    start the project
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Hemergy can organise a crowdsale of “PV panels under management”, making the project possible, and benefiting everyone.
